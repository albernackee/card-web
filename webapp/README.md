# PWA Starter Kit

This sample app is a starting point for building PWAs. Out of the box, the template
gives you the following features:
- all the PWA goodness (manifest, service worker)
- a responsive layout
- application theming
- example of using Redux for state management
- offline UI
- simple routing solution
- fast time-to-interactive and first-paint through the PRPL pattern
- easy deployment to prpl-server or static hosting
- unit and integrating testing starting points
- documentation about other advanced patterns.

## TODOs

- [x] Setup Safari testing on Travis.
- [x] Deploy all templates as demos.
- [ ] Update to latest [Material Web Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web-components).



### Design

The compendium-app reads from the URL and then calls navigate() based on it. Navigate figures out which view needs to be ensured it is loaded, and then sets state.app.page to that viewer, state.app.location to the entire location, and state.app.pageExtra to the stuff after the first part of page, so e.g. '/c/this-stuff-is/included-in-page-extra'.

That then causes card-view to be activated, with a different page-extra, which it then tells the store to show a specific card. It also checks to ensure that the URL showing is the actual card name; if not it silently updates it.

When you want to navigate to a card, you use actions/navigateToCard, which uses history.pushState, and then calls the router to extract out the URL and operate.
